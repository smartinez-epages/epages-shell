ePages shell, Beta 2

Simple command-line tool to work with the epages objects.

This experimental tool aims to include in one shell all the operations you need to work with 
epages at low level: manage objects (create, read, update, delete) and more... 

epages already includes a lot of scripts to do almost everything, but it would be nice to 
have those utilities in one tool.

        # cd epages-shell
