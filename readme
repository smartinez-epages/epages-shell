The ePages shell, a simple command-line tool to ease the interaction with the epages objects.

This is an experimental tool (Alpha version) which intends to include in one shell all the 
operations you need to work with epages at low level: manage objects (create, read, update, 
delete) and more... 

epages already includes a lot of scripts to do almost everything, but it would be nice to 
have those utilities in one tool. 

INSTALL

    Simply set the execution rights to the launcher script
    
        # cd epages-shell
        # chmod 755 she    

RUN

    Directly run the launcher
    
        # cd epages-shell
        # ./she

    Or you can start she with arguments. Command-line arguments: 

        she [ StoreName ] [ ObjectPath ]
        
    You can start she with arguments to connect a store:
        
        # she Store
    
    and select an object:
    
        # she Store /Shops/DemoShop
